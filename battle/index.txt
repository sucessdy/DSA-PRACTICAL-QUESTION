Problem:
Given an array of integers, return the first element that repeats.
If no element repeats, return -1.

Example:
[10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6] → 3
(because 3 is the first element whose second occurrence appears earliest)

Constraints (important 👀)

Time complexity target: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n) allowed

Language: your choice (C / C++ / JS — you’re comfy with all 😏)
